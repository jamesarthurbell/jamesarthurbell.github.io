        <h1>Undue Influence</h1>
        <!--Intro Quote-->
        <p><em>"Freedom of mind is the real freedom.
A person whose mind is not free though he may not be in chains, is a slave, not a free man.
One whose mind is not free, though he may not be in prison, is a prisoner and not a free man.
One whose mind is not free though alive, is no better than dead.
Freedom of mind is the proof of one's existence."</em> ~B.R. Ambedkar, Writings And Speeches

          <h2>What is undue influence?</h2>
          <p>Watching the nightly news you see a story about a
           “normal American kid” who joined ISIS. You might
           wonder, ‘What’s wrong with him? Did he have family
           problems? Is he mentally ill?’ The news journalist,
            who likely knows little about psychological
            manipulation and undue influence, often tries to
             address those questions. This usually ends up
             leaving the audience confused and disillusioned
             because nothing appeared to be wrong with him,
             he had a typical middle-class family, and he
             never exhibited any mental or emotional
             instability.</p>

             <p>What happened? He fell victim to undue
             influence.</p>

             <p>Undue influence is not exclusive to extremist
              terrorist organizations. It permeates society.
              Unfortunately, those who employ undue influence
               to psychologically manipulate people often fly
                under the radar precisely because most people
                 and groups who use it are not extremist
                 terrorists. They are often seemingly benign
                 religious groups, self-help gurus, and
                 long-established business entities.
