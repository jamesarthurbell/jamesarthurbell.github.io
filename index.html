        <h1>James Bell</h1>
        <!--Write some words about yourself in the p tags-->
        <p>I am James Bell, a sign language interpreter and captionist for deaf and hard of hearing students at Virginia Tech.
          </p>
          <h2>More about me</h2>
          <p>I have been a part-time student at Virginia Tech since the spring 1999 semester. I try to take two or three classes each year, mostly in English literature.
            </p>
          <p>I have a daughter who is sixteen years old. We have a blast doing nerdy stuff together.
            Our annual vacation is to Phoenix Comicon the first weekend in June.
            What's great about Phoenix Comicon is that it is big enough to draw really good guests,
             vendors, and events yet still only a little over half the size of San Diego Comicon.
            So it's awesome but less overwhelming.

        <h2>Ideas for my semester project</h2>
        <p><ul>
          <li>Mental health awareness - general</li>
          <li>Anxiety and Depression</li>
          <li>Manipulation & influence versus freedom of mind</li>
        </ul></p>
        <p>I am leaning toward the third option. If that is the one I select, my sources will
          include the books <em>Combating Cult Mind Control</em> by Steve Hassan and <em>Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion</em>
          by Robert Cialdini, along with the
            <a href="www.freedomofmind.com"> Freedom of Mind Resource Center</a> website.
